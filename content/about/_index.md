I'm Ashley, a software engineer at Zillow Group. I have 8+ years of experience as software engineer primarily working in C#, Python and TypeScript. I've worked both at Fortune 500 companies and startups, and most recently I've been building the platform for Zillow Home Loans, a multi million dollar business. I am endlessly curious and I am eager to take ownership of core functionality leading all the way from design to release.

# Curiosities

This page holds ideas and sources related to topics I'm curious about. Maybe one day I'll get to them all, maybe I won't. Small incremental improvement is still improvement.
